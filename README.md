# Recipe-Finder

Basic Recipe Finder website using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.  
Has 3 different types of searches, basic recipe finder, super recipe finder, and random recipe finder.  
Using a free API so there is a limited number of API calls that can be made daily, if the demo does not work, it is likely due to this issue. Sorry about that.


## Live Demo
Check out the live demo [here](https://ryanthec.github.io/Recipe-Finder/).

## How to use
Basic recipe finder allows users to enter some ingredients that they want to use and some recipes using those ingredients will be provided. However, only the ingredients are provided.  
Super recipe finder allows users to enter in 1 main ingredient as well as filter out some ingredients they might be allergic to. Super recipe finder also has the option to show the full recipe instructions together with the ingredients.  
Random recipe finder just provides a random recipe(also with full instructions) :)
